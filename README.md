# WiredTreehouse

This is a website I made and hosted on AWS S3 free tier as part of my bachelor program (information technology). I had classes in web design, AWS, cloud, etc. This was a place to experiment with concepts, colors, UI, responsive web design & S3 as a web host. (That's why there's no https option at wiredtreehouse.com.)

It lives on as a portfolio and sandbox for web projects from coding to marketing,
