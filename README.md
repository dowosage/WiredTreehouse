# WiredTreehouse

this is a website I made hosted on AWS S3 free tire.  
htm & css files are in www dir.  
started project for experimenting with colors, UI, responsive web design & s3 as a host. 

but as it went, i got more attached to it, so ended up keeping it live.  

for now, it lives on as a sandbox.  or maybe closer to a sand castle.
