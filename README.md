# WiredTreehouse

This is a website I made and hosted on AWS S3 free tier as part of my bachelor program (information technology). I had classes in web design, AWS, cloud, etc. This was a place to experiment with concepts, colors, UI, responsive web design & S3 as a web host. That's why there's no TLS for .com and ultimately why I moved it to .org and redesigned it.
